## Final Thoughts

This project is my first solo full-stack app. While simple in design, it taught me fundamental concepts and skills in developing professional web applications. My key takeaways include:

**Security matters**
  - Implementing a secure account system with password hashing and JWT authentication stored in HTTP-only cookies to mitigate CSRF and XSS attacks
    
**Clean architecture**
  - Structuring my code and repositories in a professional way to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability
    
**Building a REST API**
  - Practical experience in designing a REST API
