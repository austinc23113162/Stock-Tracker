## Final Thoughts

I know this is not a very complicated project, but I learned a lot from it. This is my first solo project, and here are my key takeaways:

- Structuring a web app in a professional way in terms of the architecture of my code and repositories
- Learning the importance and nuance of security
  - Spent a good amount of time reading about and implementing a secure account system using JWT stored in HTTP-only cookies and authentication middleware
- Implementing a REST API
